<table width="65%" border="0" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Data Entry</strong></font>.  
Select a Location, Owner, and Retention Period for the new record.  The Retention Period is always the number of years from the Record Date.  Change the Record Date if it is a date prior to the current date, or you want  to force the record storage to expire during a certain month.  The Record Date field will accept most common date formats.  The Review Date, which is used to identify expired records, will be set to the  first day of the month of the Record Date plus the Retention Period. If Retention Period is 100, Reviewdate will be set to 10 years from the Record Date. Enter the content of the record.  Content is stored in uppercase and cannot be blank.  Avoid use of apostrophes and special characters in the Content field because they may create unexpected search results.  Line feeds (enter key) should be avoided in the contents field.  The browser will break the text to fit the available space.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Validate</strong></font>.  'Validate' will check the validity of the data before adding the record to the database.  Fields needing correction will be labeled red.  If the data is correct the 'Finished' page is displayed.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Finished</strong></font>.  If the data is valid and YOU ARE SURE it is what you want, click 'Finished'.  If you make changes to the 'Finished' page, click 'Validate' to re-validate the data.  Clicking 'Finished' adds the record to the database and only a user with Administrator authority can change or remove the record.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Label Page</strong></font>.  After the new record is added to the database, the label page is displayed.  This page may be printed for a box label.  It is sized to print on half of a 2-label, letter size page.  Use the print setup functions to create the label you want.  To exit the label page, click the 'record added' link at the top of the page.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Spaces in the Contents Field</strong></font>.  When the report displays the contents field, the browser will wrap the text to fit the width of the field on the screen and the printer.  It breaks a line at the nearest space  Note that if your content description contains no spaces (highly unlikely but possible), the text will not wrap and the report will extend past the right end of the screen.  To avoid this, don't enter long content descriptions without spaces.
