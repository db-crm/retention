<table width="65%" border="0" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>The Back Button</strong></font>.  The program is not designed to use the browser 'Back' or 'Forward' buttons which may produce unexpected results.  Use the buttons in the header and on the program pages to navigate around the program.  You may always return to the menu.  If the page is formatted for printing, with no page header, there will always be be a link at the top of the page which will return you to a previous page or the menu.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Session Timeout</strong></font>.  When you log in, the program starts a 'Session' for your user id.  The session will time out if you perform no activity for the timeout period which is several minutes.  Be aware that if it times out, the program won't function.  To restart, quit and login again.
	<tr>
		<td><font color="#0000FF"><strong>Record and Box Numbers</strong></font>.  Record numbers are arbitrary and unique for all records in the database, active and deleted.  The record number is available but is not a user controlled item.  Box numbers are arbitrary and unique to the owner of the record.  Box numbers are assigned by the program and are used to identify record containers (boxes).  Both record numbers and box numbers are assigned sequentially but there may be numbers which do not exist, particularily if a record is entered incorrectly and must be removed.  The program does not recover lost record or box numbers.
